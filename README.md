# Surfs_Up_Climate_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to give the client information about temperature trends during the months of June and December in O'ahu, Hawaii in order to predict whether or not a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable throughout the year.

## Resources

How frequent are heavy rainfalls? Is there a particular month or season where it would make sense to close the shop due to a pattern of inclement weather?
