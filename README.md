# Surfs_Up_Climate_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to give the client information about temperature trends during the months of June and December in O'ahu, Hawaii in order to predict whether or not a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable throughout the year.

## Resources

- Data Sources
    - Weather Data Set provided by University of Oregon: hawaii.sqlite

- Software
    - Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0
    - SQLAlchemy 1.4.7
    - Python 3.7.10
    
## Results

The results of this analysis are outlined below.

- There is a 200 count difference between the number of times the temperature was measured in June than in December (see table 1). This could be due to the null values found and removed in the June data. There is not information about why there was no data for these times. The 200 count difference is not significant enough to impact the results of the analysis.

- There were no significant differences between the average temperature in the months of June and December (see table 1). June has an average temperature of 74.9 °F with a mean of 75 °F. December shows an average temperature of 71 °F with the same mean. The temperature in these months seems very stable.

## Summary

In 2010, heavy rainfall hit the island of O'ahu which accounts for the high precipiation average in December 

How frequent are heavy rainfalls? Is there a particular month or season where it would make sense to close the shop due to a pattern of inclement weather?
